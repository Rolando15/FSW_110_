        When I googled myself nothing ofme came up I just seen a list of many people with the same name.
        <br>
        There is not a thing that would be deemed unproffessional. If there was I would try to see where the source is coming from and find a way to get rid of it in order to not be ruled out from potential employers.
        <br>
        My social media has always been kept private. Due to being in the Military for a couple years. There is no incriminating or any nonsense on there just family and friends. 
        <br>
        My social media presence says family and fishing. Thatis about what I have on my social media.
        <br>
        If a recruiter and myself see a profile and is unproffessional I believe it would have: alcohol and drugs. Im sure theres more just too many to list.
        <br>
        My LinkedIn does not have anything updated for Web Development. Which I should and will. I have only had military expirience and went to school for an Aircraft Maintenance Certification, I do not have anything Web Development related.
        <br> 
        I would use words like Web Development student. Working on Associates Degree towards Web Development. Javascript, CSS, HTML, and DOM manipulation experience.
        <br>
        My appropriate Email is hernandezrolando85@gmail.com. Ive had this email for about 7 years now. I have chose this because it has my name, I intended just the name to be there but google email required I changed into one with a number.
        <br>
        I have not set my voicemail recording which I also need to in order to have those extra points in proffessionalism.
